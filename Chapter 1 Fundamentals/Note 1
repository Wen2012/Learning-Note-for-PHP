  <textarea name ="comments" rows = 3 cols = "30">

extra space and slash to end each input to close the tag.

Two method for data transmission
GET: sends all the gathered information along as part of the URL       
  limited information can be transmitted
  security risks
POST: invisibly to user

<form action = "handle_form.php" method ="post">

a page generated by using GET can be bookmarked, but POST can't.

POST is usually used for triggering an event on server.
